# Alerts and Communication Subproblem 

## For me: todos

* run through instructions and implement suggested changes

* Refine project readmes 

* Bluesky bot template 

* troubleshooting 

* Generate more fake data


## Problem Description 


## Part 1: Public and Internal Dashboard
### What is Google Looker Studio? 

Google Looker Studio is a free web-based data visualization tool by Google. It allows you to turn raw data — like from Google Sheets — into interactive dashboards and real-time charts, without needing to code. 

It’s perfect for building simulated alert dashboards, interactive maps, or public information panels as part of this challenge. 

## Part 2: Social Media Announcement Bot 
### 2.1 Setting up Google Sheet API 
* Access google sheets api with your python file: https://spreadsheetpoint.com/connect-python-and-google-sheets-15-minute-guide/

### 2.2 Setting up social media connection
* connect to your platform's api and send the alerts there

bot: https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/bots

### 2.3 Write your code 
* Find a way to parse the data and generate alerts based on it 

### 2.4 Deploy via Github Action
