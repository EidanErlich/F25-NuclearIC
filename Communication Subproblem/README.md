# Alerts and Communication Subproblem 

## For me: todos

* run through instructions and implement suggested changes

* Refine project readmes 

* Bluesky bot template 

* troubleshooting 

* Generate more fake data


## Problem Description 
* use lookerstudio to make a public facing dashboard
* use looker studio to make a internal facing dashboard
* use api to connect a platform with your google sheets data and broadcast alerts through it 

## Project Setup
* Access google sheets api with your python file: https://spreadsheetpoint.com/connect-python-and-google-sheets-15-minute-guide/

* Find a way to parse the data and generate alerts based on it 

* connect to your platform's api and send the alerts there
