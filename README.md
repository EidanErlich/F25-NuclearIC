# CNL Nuclear Waste Transport Monitoring Challenge

Hello and welcome!  

You’ve been selected to join a special team at the **Canadian Nuclear Labs (CNL)** to oversee an exciting new project with significant public safety challenges.  

Canada is in the process of building a **nuclear waste repository** to safely contain spent nuclear fuel generated by **CANDU reactors** from across the country. Once this facility is operational, nuclear waste must be transported by road for thousands of kilometers.  

The **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)** is responsible for regulating this project due to the significant safety risks. Vehicular or storage failure could lead to disastrous environmental or human exposure. As such, a robust **monitoring system** must be developed.  

Trucks will be carrying radioactive material through populated cities, highways, and unforeseen weather conditions — each presenting unique sensing challenges. It is CNSC’s objective to regulate the transport and handling of nuclear substances to protect:  

- The **safety and health** of the public  
- The **workers** in the nuclear sector  
- The **environment**

## Your Mission  

Your team at **CNL** has been tasked to design the **full suite of monitoring systems** that will be used to track nuclear waste transport.  

You’ve been chosen based on your ability to adapt and problem-solve while collaborating with an interdisciplinary team.  

Since starting the project, your coworkers have been reviewing **radiation monitoring, sensor technology, and system integration**. They’ve provided resources below to help you get started.  

**Preliminary focus areas:**  
- Planning and reacting to **environmental challenges** (fires, potholes, snow, floods, accidents, fuel?) during transport  
- **Loading and unloading** along the route  
- **Live vehicle state monitoring** during transport  
- **Communication technology** for emergency response  

Management at CNL has given you the green light to explore one or more of these problems in detail. You may also find a **unique way to combine solutions** across multiple areas.  

But remember: **time is of the essence!**  
Top scientists at CNL will be arriving in **two days** to assess your results.

## Sub-Problems  

### 1. Environmental Challenges and Route Planning  

Transport will take place **year-round across 4 provinces**, so a number of environmental factors could impact the safe travel of trucks carrying nuclear material.  

Examples:  
- A **forest fire** in southeastern Manitoba, causing debris, smoke, and obstacles  
- **Flooding** in Northern Ontario, affecting the Trans-Canada Highway (often the only option)  
- **Snow and icy conditions** in the winter  

**Current mitigation methods:**  
- Sensing for immediate obstacles or hazards  
- Communication to headquarters for real-time updates  
- Careful route planning  

**Challenge:**  
Design a system to optimize truck routing given environmental challenges and on-route resources (e.g., gas stations).  

**Potential Solutions:**  
- External sensors for monitoring **temperature and humidity**  
- **Computer vision or LIDAR** for pothole detection  
- Remote sensors for **landscape monitoring**  
- **Route optimization** algorithms  

**Example Solution Description:**  
Code written to take map data and plan the most optimal route from several nuclear sites (marked blue) to the planned repository location (marked green). The system accounts for environmental obstacles and weather events that might make a route less desirable, such as a forest fire placed along the initial route (red marked area).

# CNL Nuclear Waste Transport Challenge – Sub-Problem Areas  

---

## Loading & Unloading  

The continuous monitoring of nuclear materials during all stages of transportation is vital for ensuring the **safety of the materials, the environment, and the personnel involved**.  

During transit, there are instances where the **fuel cask must be transferred from one mode of transport to another**. This process involves lifting the sealed transportation package from one vehicle and securing it onto another.  

Despite the implementation of strict protocols and layered safety measures, incidents such as **material spills, equipment malfunctions, or accidental drops** may still occur. These transfers may take place at **non-dedicated or transitional sites**, making them more susceptible to **unauthorized access**. This increases the risk of tampering or interference by individuals with malicious intent.  

The CNSC would like to **improve its safety surveillance** for the loading and unloading process. Possible approaches include implementing a monitoring system, facilitating safer handling of the container cask, or designing alternative methods to reduce risks.  

### Challenge  
Design a system to enable a **safer nuclear transfer process between vehicles** that minimizes the possibility of material tampering and unauthorized intrusion to the transfer site.  

### Minimum Requirements  
- Contains elements of **safety enhancement** for nuclear material during loading and unloading  
- Utilizes **technical tools** to notify users of potential safety risks  

### Potential Solutions  
- **Computer vision** area surveillance  
- **Tetrix robot** to remove obstacles from the loading/unloading area  
- **Mechanical system** to aid loading and unloading  

### Resources  
- Basic setup materials  
- Foundation source code  
- OpenCV applications for image detection  
- Map of loading/unloading areas  
- [Roboflow datasets](https://roboflow.com/)  
- [Custom training tutorial](https://roboflow.com/train)  

### Example Solution 
- Computer vision to identify personnel on scene

## Vehicle State Monitoring  

Trucks will be travelling from **New Brunswick to Manitoba**, transporting spent fuel to the deep repository. This includes travel through various environments and weather conditions, each impacting the transport vehicle.  

- **Vibrations** on uneven ground increase the risk of containers or fastenings coming loose  
- **Rain** reduces visibility and creates slippery road conditions  
- **Tire quality** impacts safe transport  
- **Loading/unloading** into different vehicles may change weight distribution, causing instability  

Spent fuel is transported in heavily shielded casks. Radiation is very difficult to detect externally, but if shielding is compromised, **radiation leakage** becomes possible.  

For this challenge, instead of real radiation, a **433 MHz RF signal** will be used as a substitute. This can be easily shielded with aluminum foil to simulate shielding effects.  

### Challenge  
Develop a system to **improve planning, monitoring, or reacting** to vehicle and container state changes.  

### Potential Solutions  
- Vehicle sensor package to monitor **vibrations, orientation, internal temperature, radiation (RF proxy), and other key signals**  
- System reports anomalies directly to the **driver**  

### Resources  
- **Arduino Uno R4 Minima**  
- **Grove sensor kit**  
- Additional sensors:  
  - DFRobot BMX160 9-Axis IMU  
  - Adafruit AHT20 Temperature & Humidity Sensor  
  - HX53/HXM121 Infrared Transmitter/Receiver  
  - TX118S-4 / RX480-E-WQ 433 MHz RF Transmitter/Receiver

## Communications with Authorities  

Effective **communication systems** are essential to ensure the operational integrity of nuclear waste transport.  

In the event of:  
- Collision  
- Route deviation  
- Container breach  
- Alarming sensor readings  

...alerts must be **sent immediately** to the appropriate authorities to initiate a rapid response.  

### Challenge  
Create a system specialized to **improve communication with authorities, administration, or the public** in the event of an emergency.  

### Potential Solutions  
- Simulate an **emergency alert** (e.g., text, light, or sound) that activates near the transport vehicle if a high-risk event occurs  
- Implement a **logging & escalation mechanism** with progressive alerts depending on severity  
- Enable **inter-vehicular/dispatch communication**  

### Resources  
- (To be provided by CNSC)

## Public Warnings Communication  

An important part of any large-scale transport operation is **public communication**.  

### Challenge  
Design a system for communication between **transport management and the public**. (Can be emergency-related, public relations, or informational.)  

### Potential Solutions  
- **Emergency notification simulation**: send alerts (email notifications, popups, or signage) representing a public warning  
- **Public information webpage**:  
  - Explain nuclear waste transport and how it’s kept safe  
  - Provide instructions for the public in case of an incident  
  - Simulate transport routes (without revealing real sensitive data)
