# CNL Nuclear Waste Transport Monitoring Challenge

Hello and welcome!  

You’ve been selected to join a special team at the **Canadian Nuclear Labs (CNL)** to oversee an exciting new project with significant public safety challenges.  

Canada is in the process of building a **nuclear waste repository** located in Ignace to safely contain spent nuclear fuel generated by **CANDU reactors** from across the country. Once this facility is operational, nuclear waste will need to be transported thousands of kilometres by road to Ignace from nuclear power plants all across Canada.  

The **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)** is responsible for regulating this project due to the significant safety risks. Vehicular or storage failure could lead to disastrous environmental or human exposure. As such, a robust **monitoring system** must be developed to not only detect exposure, but also to protect against anyone who would want to use the nuclear waste nefariously.  

Trucks will be carrying radioactive material through populated cities, highways, and unforeseen weather conditions — each presenting unique sensing challenges. It is CNSC’s objective to regulate the transport and handling of nuclear substances to protect:  

- The **safety and health** of the public  
- The **workers** in the nuclear sector  
- The **environment**

## Your Mission  

Your team at **CNL** has been tasked to design the **various monitoring systems** that will be used to monitor the nuclear waste transport. Collaborating interdisciplinary team, you're tasked with deriving a method of solving various subproblems. Since starting the project, your predecessors have been reviewing **radiation monitoring, sensor technology, and system integration**. They’ve provided strong fundamental groundwork and resources below to help with your team's solution development.  

**Sub-Problems:**  
- **Live vehicle state monitoring** during transport 
- **Route planning** and reacting to **environmental challenges** (fires, potholes, snow, floods, accidents, fuel, etc.) during transport  
- **Loading and unloading** along the route  
- **Communication technology** for emergency response  

Your task is to develop a solution to one or more of these subproblems that withstands CNL's expectations and standards. You may also find a **unique way to combine solutions** across multiple areas. Remember: **time is of the essence!** Top scientists at CNL will be arriving in **two days** to assess your results.

Please remember to work pragmatically and safely. For more information, please review **[nuclear_transport_Q_and_As.pdf](https://github.com/IdeasClinicUWaterloo/F25-NuclearIC/blob/main/nuclear_transport_Q_and_As.pdf)**.

## Sub-Problems  

### Vehicle State Monitoring  

Trucks will be travelling from **all four provinces to the deposition site in Ignace**, transporting spent fuel to the deep repository. This includes travelling through various environments and weather conditions, each impacting the transport vehicle, such as:  

- **Vibrations** on uneven ground increase the risk of containers or fastenings coming loose  
- **Rain** reduces visibility and creates slippery road conditions  
- **Tire quality** impacts safe transport  
- **Loading/unloading** into different vehicles may change weight distribution, causing instability  

Spent fuel is transported in heavily shielded casks. Radiation is very difficult to detect externally, but if shielding is compromised, **radiation leakage** becomes possible.  

#### Challenge:
For this challenge, instead of real radiation, an **IR emitter** will be used as a substitute. Your team is tasked with developing a system to **improve planning, monitoring, or reacting** to vehicle and container state changes. The [Sensor Package Subproblem](https://github.com/IdeasClinicUWaterloo/F25-NuclearIC/tree/main/Sensor%20Package%20Subproblem) files cover in-depth methods of implementing various sensors and tools to gauge the conditions of the transport truck accurately.

### Environmental Challenges and Route Planning  

Transport will take place **year-round across 4 provinces**—Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, and New Brunswick, so several environmental factors could impact the safe travel of trucks carrying nuclear material, such as:

- A **forest fire** in southeastern Manitoba, causing debris, smoke, and obstacles  
- **Flooding** in Northern Ontario, affecting the Trans-Canada Highway (often the only option)  
- **Snow and icy conditions** in the winter  

#### Challenge: 
Design a system to optimize truck routing given environmental challenges and on-route resources (e.g., gas stations).
**Please read the Route Optimization SubProblem for more detailed information.**

The example solution in the tutorial provided in [Route_Optimization_Subproblem](https://github.com/IdeasClinicUWaterloo/F25-NuclearIC/tree/main/Route_Optimization_Subproblem) creates a map and plans the most optimal route from several nuclear sites (marked blue) to the planned repository location (marked violet). The system accounts for environmental obstacles and weather events that might make a route less desirable, such as a forest fire along the initial route (red-marked area).

### Loading & Unloading  

The continuous monitoring of nuclear materials during all stages of transportation is vital for ensuring the **safety of the materials, the environment, and the personnel involved**.  

During transit, there are instances where the **Flask must be loaded and unloaded** into and out of transport trucks safely. This process requires heavy monitoring to ensure the safety of the employees. Despite the implementation of strict protocols and layered safety measures, incidents such as **material spills, equipment malfunctions, or accidental drops** may still occur.  **Unauthorized Personnel** may try to access the material during transportation. This increases the risk of tampering or interference by individuals with malicious intent.  

The CNSC would like to **improve its safety surveillance** for the loading and unloading process. Possible approaches include implementing a monitoring system, facilitating safer handling of the container cask, or designing alternative methods to reduce risks.  

#### Challenge:  
Design a system to enable a **safe nuclear transfer process** that minimizes the possibility of exposure, material tampering, and unauthorized intrusion to the transfer site. The example solution in the tutorial provided in [Loading_Unloading_Subproblem](https://github.com/IdeasClinicUWaterloo/F25-NuclearIC/tree/main/Loading_Unloading_Subproblem) uses open-source CV to analyze the transfer site, ensuring that the transfer site is safe and that there is no unauthorized personnel.

### Alerts and Communication 
In the case of an emergency, timely alerts must be sent out to both **the authorities and the public**. The authorities must get a comprehensive overview of the situation so that they can prepare their response accordingly, while the public must be warned of threats and any safety measures to follow. 

A system is needed for transforming raw vehicle state data into actionable information and then effectively communicating it. Effective communication must consider style, audience, and the channel through which you communicate. Communication in the system can happen through multiple channels, such as social media and an internal real-time dashboard.  

#### Challenge:  
Create a system specialized to **improve communication with authorities, administration, and the public** in the event of an emergency. The example solution outlined in the [Communication Subproblem](https://github.com/IdeasClinicUWaterloo/F25-NuclearIC/tree/main/Communication_Subproblem) includes a **public dashboard and a Bluesky alert bot**.
