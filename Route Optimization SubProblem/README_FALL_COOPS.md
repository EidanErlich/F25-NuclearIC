Hey everybody, I have left working code and example visuals for route optimization.
Please run through this sub-problem as though you are students without just copypasting, as you'll have to deterine how complex it is
from there, choose to leave certain resources and create instructions to make it feasible but not trivial

What needs to be done:

You absolutely must supply the file ON_MB_Road_Data.graphml, as downloading it takes too long for the students
Relevant libraries like OSMNX, NetworkX, should included
Tutorial for setting up a Venv in VS code and installing the metnioned libraries
Hints and tutorials as you see fit after having run through the challenge to gauge its difficulty

What files are here?  
*GeoJson:* contains coords and names for relevant nuclear sites and repository, needed for students  
*Code.md* is my example code, should work so long as you have map data file, GeoJson, libraries  
*Optimized_Route_with_fire.html* is just the output of my example code, download and open w/ chrome  
*Road data file* IS NOT HERE: its too big even zipped to be uploaded, find it in TEAMS. Talk to Chris, this has to be given to students before they start working on code. It is called ON_MB_Road_Data

Heres a visual i have for the map data I downloaded, might want to have to help see whats downloaded(ontario and part of manitoba to loop in CNL pinawa location)
