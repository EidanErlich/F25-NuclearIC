## Problem Description 


## Solution Template
### Part 1: Public and Internal Dashboard
#### What is Google Looker Studio? 

Google Looker Studio is a free web-based data visualization tool by Google. It allows you to turn raw data — like from Google Sheets — into interactive dashboards and real-time charts, without needing to code. 

It’s perfect for building simulated alert dashboards, interactive maps, or public information panels as part of this challenge. 

### Part 2: Social Media Announcement Bot 
#### 2.1 Setting up Google Sheet API 
* Access google sheets api with your python file: https://spreadsheetpoint.com/connect-python-and-google-sheets-15-minute-guide/

#### 2.2 Setting up social media connection
* connect to your platform's api and send the alerts there  
for bluesky: 

#### 2.3 Write your code 
* Find a way to parse the data and generate alerts based on it 

#### 2.4 Deploy via Github Action
